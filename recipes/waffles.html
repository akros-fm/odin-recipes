      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>
          <h3>Eggs</h3>
          <p>This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Flour</h3>
          <p>All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Milk</h3>
          <p>Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Oil</h3>
          <p>A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Sugar</h3>
          <p>A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Baking powder</h3>
          <p>Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Salt</h3>
          <p>A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Vanilla</h3>
          <p> dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Cooking spray</h3>
          <p>You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
