    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <p>
        Feijoada is a dish made throughout Brazil.Brazil has many region-specific dishes, yet the the one that best translates into a nationwide dish is the beloved feijoada. The name stems from the word feijão (bean), the key ingredient of feijoada – which is essentially a bean stew mixed with beef and pork. Its Portuguese origins has made the dish popular across the country, but it is also served in places as far away as Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde, with recipe variations in each country.

      <p>
        It is widely believed that the beginnings of feijoada stem from slavery in Brazil, where slaves put together the scraps of leftover beans and meat from their owners to create a kind of stew. However, academics have recently challenged this theory, claiming the origin of feijoada comes from the European settlers. Beans became one of their main foods thanks to its low-maintenance and lost-cost production. They added in cuts of meat and started to create a stew that could be cooked in large quantities and didn’t demand much effort to make. Regardless of the origins, nowadays feijoada is a truly Brazilian dish that is enjoyed and celebrated all across the country.
